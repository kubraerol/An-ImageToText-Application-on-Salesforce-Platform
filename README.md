# An-ImageToText-Application-on-Salesforce-Platform

The use of image to text technologies can be beneficial in business life. E.g; In some institutions, handwritten forms must be entered into the information technology system used, and this process is carried out manually by people spending hours. This process can be automated with the handwriting recognition technique.  

With the effect of this idea, I used the Salesforce.com platform, which is a crm platform used by many large companies, as a development tool in the study.

Tools

The development was developed on the Salesforce.com platform. Apex is used for backend development and aura component is used for frontend development.
A free developer account can be created to work on the Salesforce platform (https://developer.salesforce.com/signup). I created a Salesforce developer
account. Then, I integrate it with Intellij IDE and the development was carried out using the Intellij IDE.

In addition, I used Google Cloud Vision API to perform image-to-text operation. Technical details about the service can be found at https://cloud.google.com/vision .In order to use these services, the authentication key had to be obtained first. I obtained this key by creating an account at https://console.cloud.google.com/.


Test and Results

In the study, English texts were studied, but there is also the opportunity to use the services in different languages including Turkish. Very good results were obtained in the tests. Some tests are shared below.
